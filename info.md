# Welcome

Bienvenue sur le stream d'[{{ site.data.social.twitch }}](https://twitch.tv/{{ site.data.social.twitch }}).
Le Stream utilise le mod
[Twitch Toolkit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1718525787) qui propose une expérienceinteractive..
There's a lot to the mod that may seem complicated to even more experienced
users, but this short guide will help you get the hang of things.

## What is Twitch Toolkit?

Twitch Toolkit est un mod créé par hodlhodl qui permet aux spectateurs d’interagir avec le jeu de plusieurs façons.
La plus connue est sa [store]({{- "/" | relative_url -}}), qui permet d’acheter différents éléments choisis par le streamer.
Selon l’achat, ces éléments apparaissent dans le jeu ou influencent le déroulement de la partie d'une manière ou d'une autre.
Une autre façon pour les spectateurs d’interagir est via les sondages proposés par le mod.
Les choix dans ces sondages dépendent fortement des options activées dans le mod.
## What Are Coins?

Coins are the mod's currency. You can view your balance by using the `{{ bal }}` command. 

{% if utils == true %}
You'll notice the balance command may have some new emojis. If that's the case, here is an overview
of the emojis as follows:

- 💰 represents the amount of coins you current have.
- ⚖ represents your current karma.
- 📈 represents the amount of coins you gain everytime the mod awards coins.
- 📉 represents the amount of coins you lose everytime to mod awards coins.

{% endif %}


{%- if lootboxes == true -%}
You'll also notice that you'll get a message from the bot about a lootbox. You can open this lootbox
by using the `!openlootbox` command, as well as check the number of lootboxes you have with `!lootboxes`.
You'll always get a new lootbox everyday.
{%- endif -%}

## What is Karma?

Karma is a system in the mod that tries to limit the amount of negative events a viewer can purchase at
one time. This system works by directly modifying that amount of coins viewers get everytime the mod
awards coins. This means that the lower you karma is, the lower your coin gain is. The hope is that
negative events get spread out more so the colony can recover.

## How Do I Use Twitch Toolkit?

You can use Twitch Toolkit in a number of ways -- the most prominent way is through its
[commands]({{- "/commands" | relative_url -}}). The more important command is the `{{- buy -}}`
command, which is the mods entry point into purchasing things from the store. Other notable commands
are the `!mypawn` commands, which allow you see various information about your pawn. We won't cover
every command here, but most commands should generally be self-descriptive or have a description of
what they do on the [commands]({{- "/commands" | relative_url -}}) page.

## What is Puppeteer?

[Puppeteer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2057192142) is a mod by Brrainz that
allows viewers to directly control their pawns, and even view a number of information about your pawn in
a graphical way. It also redirects some of the responses from Twitch Toolkit to its website to clean up
chat a bit. So, if you're logged into Puppeeter and you're wondering why the bot isn't responding to you,
you should check the `TT` tab on the website first.
